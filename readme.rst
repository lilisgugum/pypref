Database Preferences and Skyline Computation in Python
======================================================

Routines to select and visualize the maxima for a given strict partial 
order. This especially includes the computation of the Pareto 
frontier, also known as (Top-k) Skyline operator, and some 
generalizations (database preferences).

This the Python porting of the rPref package.
